**Ma**ss-**re**naming **to**ol

</div>

This project aims to create a cross-platform tool to easily rename many files at once. So far, the only tools I've found to fulfil this purpose are pure regex tools with no real overview of what is happening. In Mareto, you get the overview, you get the regex (when it gets implemented), and you get to edit the names manually without having to close and open a renaming dialog for each file.

This project is in early alpha state and can currently not do more than show the files and folders of a selected folder. To see what is currently planned, see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

Note: while this aims to be a cross-platform application, it is only being tested on x86_64 linux right now.
